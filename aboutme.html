        <p class="lead">
          In March 2023, Kay will graduate from Portland State University with a
          Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. Though she was introduced to
          computer coding through artistic endeavours, she has an interest in
          cyber security and hopes to get an internship in that field during her
          last term at Portland State University.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Her coding roots started with her collaborative gallery exhibits back
          when she was pursuing her Associates of Science in Music and Sonic
          Arts at Portland Community College. During this time, she discovered
          how to create digital interactive art. Along with classmates and
          friends she met along the way, Kay became an artist in a few gallery
          exhibits before COVID-19. She created art through coding (mainly in
          Java). By using the Microsoft Kinect, Processing, Java, JavaScript,
          Arduino, Microcontrollers, and more, she created art for the public to
          interact with that blurred the lines between technology and art. The
          juxtaposition of the strict logical components of computers and the
          lucid emotional passion of art fueled her inspiration.

          Kay has always enjoyed math and art. This webside showcases some
          projects that she did for another class at Portland State University,
          "Exploring Fractals". This class was a perfect combination of art and
          mathematics. She highly recommends it for all students interested in
          math and coding, and using it to discover and create art.

        <h3>Mass Residue</h3>
        <p>
          A gallery exhibit with female artists in the community.
          <br />
          I created interactive projections with Java and the Kinect.

        <h3>Body Image Ltd</h3>
        <p>
          A collaboration within the Portland Community College Creative Coding
          Capstone class.
          <br />
          I created interactive visual piece, where people could put their hands
          on a mannequin's shoulders and peak inside the mannequin to see an odd
          film playing. When hands were placed on the shoulder, a camera would
          turn on and project a video of their eye while they were watching the
          video.
